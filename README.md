# Palmora-Group-HR-Analysis-Dashboard
HR data analysis for Palmora Group using Power BI. Identified gender distribution, salary gaps , bonus allocation and compliance with wage regulation across departments and region

## Overview

This project analyzes HR data from **Palmora Group**, a Nigerian manufacturing company facing gender-related workplace challenges across its 3 regions. The goal is to uncover **gender disparities**, evaluate **salary structure**, assess **performance ratings**, and ensure **compliance** with wage regulations.

The analysis was conducted entirely in **Power BI**, and insights were derived to support management decisions aimed at improving gender equity and compensation policies.

##  Objectives

- Understand gender distribution across regions and departments
- Analyze performance ratings by gender
- Identify any gender-based salary gaps
- Check compliance with the new minimum wage regulation ($90,000)
- Allocate annual bonuses based on performance ratings
- Visualize key HR metrics for leadership review

##  Tools Used

- **Power BI Desktop** ‚Äì for data cleaning, modeling, and dashboard creation
- **Power BI Custom Columns** ‚Äì used to create calculated fields like salary bands, bonuses, and total compensation


##  Data Cleaning Steps

All cleaning was performed directly in **Power BI** using built-in transformations and logic. The following steps were taken:

- Replaced missing genders with `"Undisclosed"`
- Removed employees with `NULL` in the `Department` field
- Removed employees with no salary (indicating they are no longer with the company)

##  Visuals and Dashboards

All visuals were created in **Power BI** and exported for preview. Below are key charts used in the analysis:
